The error fatal: Authentication failed indicates that Git was unable to authenticate with the remote repository. This can happen for various reasons, such as incorrect credentials or an outdated authentication method. Here's how to resolve it on Linux, with an example:

Steps to Fix the Error
1. Verify Your Credentials
Make sure you have the correct username and password or personal access token (PAT) if the repository requires it.
GitHub stopped supporting password authentication in August 2021. Use a PAT instead.
2. Use a Personal Access Token (PAT)
Generate a PAT from GitHub:
Log in to your GitHub account.
Go to Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic).
Click Generate new token (classic).
Select the appropriate scopes (e.g., repo for full access to private/public repositories).
Copy the generated token.
3. Update the Repository URL
Replace the username and password in the repository URL with your PAT.

bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin https://<your-username>:<your-token>@github.com/Keshari07/26-November-PNQ.git
Example:

bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin https://johnDoe:ghp_ABC1234XYZ5678@github.com/Keshari07/26-November-PNQ.git
4. Store Credentials Using Credential Manager
Use Git's credential helper to store your credentials securely.

bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper store
Run a command like git pull, enter your username and PAT when prompted, and Git will store them for future use.

5. Verify Authentication
Test the connection by running:

bash
Copy code
git pull
Example
Check Current Remote URL:

bash
Copy code
git remote -v
Update URL with PAT: Replace the old URL with the new one containing your PAT:

bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin https://<your-username>:<your-token>@github.com/Keshari07/26-November-PNQ.git
Store the Credentials:

bash
Copy code
git config --global credential.helper store
Test the Connection:

bash
Copy code
git pull
Troubleshooting
SSH Key Authentication: If you prefer SSH over HTTPS, configure your SSH keys:

Generate an SSH key:
bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@example.com"
Add the key to your GitHub account under Settings > SSH and GPG keys.
Update the remote URL to use SSH:
bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Keshari07/26-November-PNQ.git
Test with:
bash
Copy code
git pull
Check Network Issues: Ensure there are no proxy or firewall restrictions blocking GitHub.
